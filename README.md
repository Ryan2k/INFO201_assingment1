In this assignment, you'll edit this `README.md` file to create a Markdown document that describes a news story (full instructions on Canvas). You'll also keep track of the terminal commands you use in the `session.sh` file (you don't ever need to _run_ that file -- it's just to show us _how_ you can use terminal commands).

When you're finished, please **delete this text**, leaving only the Markdown that you've written. Make sure to **submit this GitHub URL** to Canvas on time for full credit.
